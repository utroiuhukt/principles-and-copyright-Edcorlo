##How does the GNU Manifesto justify the ethical importance of free software?

When Unix stopped sharing its source code to be able to study it and other possibilities, 
GNU's appeared as a way to maintain and create a software that kept those principles of freedom, 
autonomy and the shared use of it. 

Therefore, GNU Manifesto justifies the ethical importance of free software by framing it as a matter of freedom, collaboration, and social responsibility. It argues that software should be a tool for empowerment, not control, 
and that the freedom to use, study, modify, and share software is essential for a just and equitable society. 
By promoting free software, the GNU Project seeks to create a world where technology serves the common good rather than corporate interests.
