## How does the GNU Manifesto justify the ethical importance of free software?

When Unix stopped sharing its source code, preventing users from studying and modifying it, GNU emerged as a way to maintain and create software that upheld principles of freedom, autonomy, and shared use.

The GNU Manifesto justifies the ethical importance of free software by framing it as a matter of **freedom, collaboration, and social responsibility**. It argues that software should be a tool for empowerment, not control, and that the freedom to use, study, modify, and share software is essential for a just and equitable society. By promoting free software, the GNU Project seeks to create a world where technology serves the common good rather than corporate interests.

## What is the difference between "open source" and "free software"?

Free software and open source are closely related but distinct concepts:

- **Free Software**:
  - Championed by Richard Stallman and the Free Software Foundation (FSF).
  - Emphasizes **ethical principles** and the **Four Freedoms**.
  - Ensures users have the liberty to use, study, modify, and share software.
  - Views software freedom as a **moral imperative** and opposes proprietary restrictions.

- **Open Source**:
  - Promoted by the Open Source Initiative (OSI).
  - Focuses on the **practical benefits** of making source code available.
  - Aims to foster collaboration, innovation, and improve software quality.
  - Adopts a more **pragmatic, business-friendly approach**.

While most free software is also open source, and vice versa, the key difference lies in their **philosophy and messaging**: free software is about **freedom and ethics**, while open source is about **practical advantages and development models**.
