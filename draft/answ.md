##How does the GNU Manifesto justify the ethical importance of free software?##

When Unix stopped sharing its source code to be able to study it and other possibilities, 
GNU's appeared as a way to maintain and create a software that kept those principles of freedom, 
autonomy and the shared use of it. 

Therefore, GNU Manifesto justifies the ethical importance of free software by framing it as a matter of freedom, collaboration, and social responsibility. It argues that software should be a tool for empowerment, not control, 
and that the freedom to use, study, modify, and share software is essential for a just and equitable society. 
By promoting free software, the GNU Project seeks to create a world where technology serves the common good rather than corporate interests.


##What is the difference between "open source" and "free software"?
  
free software and open source are closely related but distinct concepts. Free software, championed by Richard Stallman and the Free Software Foundation (FSF), emphasizes ethical principles and the Four Freedomsâ€”ensuring users have the liberty to use, study, modify, and share software. It views software freedom as a moral imperative and opposes proprietary restrictions.

On the other hand, open source, promoted by the Open Source Initiative (OSI), focuses on the practical benefits of making source code available, such as fostering collaboration, innovation, and improving software quality. It adopts a more pragmatic, business-friendly approach.
